I started in IT support, but what’s always interested me most is what sits behind the problems users experience. I enjoy tracing issues back to their root causes whether that’s a process gap, a configuration problem, or an opportunity for automation and building better systems around them.

Over time, my role has evolved from fixing individual issues to improving how IT operates as a whole. I focus on reducing friction for users, strengthening reliability and security, and making IT environments easier to manage at scale.
