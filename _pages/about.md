I am an IT Support Specialist with over 2 years of hands-on experience supporting more than 500 users at Propel Holdings, a leading financial tech institution, where I gained exposure to strict compliance and security practices.

I manage user identities and access across Entra ID/Active Directory, Microsoft 365, and Intune, ensuring secure onboarding and offboarding. I automated device deployment with Intune Autopilot, cutting setup time from four hours to under one. My support in an MDM expansion secured over 400 corporate devices, boosting compliance and reducing security incidents. I supported a Windows 10 to 11 migration for over 400 devices in three weeks with minimal disruption. I built PowerShell scripts and KACE automation to enhance patching, software deployment, and system visibility. I also create knowledge base articles to improve IT workflow efficiency.
