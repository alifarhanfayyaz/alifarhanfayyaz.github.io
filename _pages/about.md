I am an IT Support Specialist with over 2 years of hands-on experience supporting more than 500 users at Propel Holdings, a leading financial tech institution, where I gained exposure to strict compliance and security practices. I am now pursuing a transition into cybersecurity, with projects focused on analyzing ransomware techniques and investigating infostealer threats.

My skills include malware analysis, scripting (PowerShell, Linux bash), threat intelligence, incident response, patch management, virtualization, and operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS) .
